                <p>Hello everyone! My name is Khalil Mustapha, I am 27 years old and I was born and raised in a little city called Dearborn, Michigan. 
                    It is just outside of "Hockeytown" otherwise known as Detroit. 
                    Originally my family is from a country in the Middle East called Lebanon. A couple of hobbies of mine include drawing, playing sports, binge watching as many shows as I possibly can (Money Heist is my favorite in case you were wondering). 
                    For about the past 5 years, I have been working in Real Estate with my father, who has been doing it for 25 years. It is a great industry to be in no matter the time. 
                    With that being said, I have told myself it is time to further my education and that is when I came across computer coding. 
                    The idea resonated in me and I began searching for ways to begin my journey.

                <h1>Why?</h1>
                <strong>Why Coding? Why Software Engineering? Why Coding Temple?</strong>

                <p>The question always seems to come up as to...why? To be completely honest, I am very new to this field of work and I know it will be a long journey. 
                    The whole idea first began when I was hanging out with a couple of my friends and we were discussing work. 
                    Everyone was going around talking about their day at work and then my friend who is a software engineer began talking about his day. While listening to everything, I began to become heavily invested in the topic.
                    After that night, I asked my friend more questions about the field. With his help, I began researching good ways to dive into coding. As fate would have it, I stumbled across Coding Temple and instantly knew I wanted to be a part this program.
                    I know it will be challenging and take tremendous effort but knowing this, it will just make the end result that much sweeter. </p>
